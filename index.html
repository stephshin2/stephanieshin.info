	<h1> Hello, world! </h1>
	<h2> What's up! I'm Stephanie Shin! </h2>

			<p> Okay yeah, just kidding. However much I do wish I was as cute as this puppy, I'm not. It's just a tough reality I have to face.</p>
	<p> Anyways, I wasn't really sure what to make my first website about, so bare with me. </p>

	<ol> Here are a couple of the things I considered: 
		<li> Cute puppies. Obviously. But, I thought pictures could get old after a while. 
			<ul>
				<li> Who I am kidding that would've been a great idea...</li>
				<li> Note to self: for my next website. </li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li> The Office. It's probably my favorite show, so I could've honestly filled this page with pictures of Michael Scott and have been done with it. 
			<ul> 
				<li> Another great idea. </li>
				<li> I should really put this list that I'm making to use. </li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li> Random ranting. Let's face it- there are a lot of things wrong with the world that are worth talking about. Plus, that's mostly all I did when I first learned how to speak this new language, so why not!
			<ul>
				<li> But... I've pretty much already covered that. </li>
				<li> And you'd probably just become or already are really annoyed because of it. </li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p> In the end I realized, why not make this website a little bit about all of those things! (Plus, then I get to do more of the cool, new things I learned) </p>

	<p> So ladies and gents/the approximate 2 people looking at this website... </p>
	<p> I present to you in the format of a table with various images that link to websites... </p>
